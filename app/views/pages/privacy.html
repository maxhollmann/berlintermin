<h3 class="h">General</h3>
<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please <a href="mailto:info@berlintermin.com">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

<h3 class="h">Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, BerlinTermin collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. BerlinTermin's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how BerlinTermin's visitors use its website. From time to time, BerlinTermin may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>BerlinTermin also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments and reviews on the site. BerlinTermin only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

<h3 class="h">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to BerlinTermin’s website choose to interact with BerlinTermin in ways that require BerlinTermin to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that BerlinTermin gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. <!--For example, we allow visitors to sign up to BerlinTermin using their <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> account. In that case, BerlinTermin retrieves and stores the user's first and last name, email address, and profile picture from Facebook. -->In each case, BerlinTermin collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with BerlinTermin. BerlinTermin does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<h3 class="h">Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>BerlinTermin may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. BerlinTermin may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, BerlinTermin does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h3 class="h">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>BerlinTermin discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on BerlinTermin’s behalf or to provide services available at BerlinTermin’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using BerlinTermin’s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. BerlinTermin will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, BerlinTermin discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when BerlinTermin believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of BerlinTermin, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the BerlinTermin website and have supplied your email address<!-- or signed in using your Facebook account -->, BerlinTermin may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with BerlinTermin and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. BerlinTermin takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

BerlinTermin uses cookies to help BerlinTermin identify and track visitors, their usage of BerlinTermin website, and their website access preferences. BerlinTermin visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using BerlinTermin’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of BerlinTermin’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h3 class="h">Business Transfers</h3>
<p>If BerlinTermin, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that BerlinTermin goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of BerlinTermin may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by BerlinTermin and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
